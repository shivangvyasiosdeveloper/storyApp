Text Editor with offline support

- User should be able to write a story in both online and offline modes

- Users should be able to write multiple stories.

- Each story should have a title and text content.

- Stories should be saved to the server when the user goes online (dummy API call. Log the story title and ID).

We are expecting a scalable solution.
